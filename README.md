# Text-Classification
In this project, I have trained a model that classifies given paragraphs into 20 groups (religion, politics...etc.).
20NewsGroup dataset containing around 11.3k paragraphs used to train the model. Text data was cleaned, and
top words or features were chosen and converted to Term-Frequency Bag Of Word representation. Training and
classification were done using the Naive Bayes Classifier(built from scratch). After training, the model was giving
84% accuracy.

It is coded in Python, Jupyter.
