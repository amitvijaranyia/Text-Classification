# Text-Classification
Here I used 20 News Group dataset in which around 11314 passages are given along with their groups(like religion, politics...etc). Here first i cleaned the data using NLP and later classification is done using sklearn's inbuilt Multinomial Classifier and Naive Bayes classifier(built from scratch) and accuracy of both classifier is being compared.
